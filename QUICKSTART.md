## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Legal**: Downloading YouTube videos may violate YouTube's TOS. Use responsibly.
2. **API**: The app uses external APIs (yt1d.com). If one fails, it tries alternatives.
3. **Permissions**: The app will ask for storage permissions on first download.
4. **Internet**: Requires active internet connection to fetch download links.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No connected devices"
- Start an Android emulator, OR
- Connect your Android phone via USB with USB debugging enabled

### Build errors
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### API not working
- The APIs (yt1d.com, yt5s.io) may change. You might need to update the endpoints in `lib/youtube_service.dart`
