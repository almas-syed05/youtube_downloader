# ðŸš€ Next Steps - Deploy Your App!

Your YouTube Downloader is ready to be deployed! Here's what I've prepared:

## âœ… What's Ready

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Automatically builds APK on every push
2. **Railway Configuration** - Backend server ready to deploy
3. **Documentation** - Complete deployment guide created

## ðŸ“‹ Follow These Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `youtube_downloader`
3. Make it **Public** (so anyone can download APK)
4. Don't initialize with anything
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code

Run these commands (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/youtube_downloader.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Wait for APK to Build

- Go to your repo â†’ "Actions" tab
- Wait ~5 minutes for the build to complete
- APK will be in "Releases" section

### Step 4: Deploy Backend to Railway

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your `youtube_downloader` repo
5. **IMPORTANT:** Set root directory to `merge_server`
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Go to Settings â†’ Generate Domain
8. Copy your URL (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app`)

### Step 5: Update App with Railway URL

Open `lib/main.dart` and find line ~44:

```dart
static const String mergeApiUrl = "http://10.0.2.2:3000/merge";
```

Replace with:

```dart
static const String mergeApiUrl = "https://your-app.up.railway.app/merge";
```

Then commit and push:

```powershell
git add lib/main.dart
git commit -m "Update to Railway backend URL"
git push
```

### Step 6: Share Your App!

Your APK download link:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/youtube_downloader/releases/latest
```
